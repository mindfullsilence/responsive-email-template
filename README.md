Responsive Email Template
=========================

Used for creating easy responsive email templates.

## Steps
  1. Create a new html file for your email
  2. Copy the "begin.html" contents into your file
  3. Copy the contents of the layout you want. E.g: if you want a 2 column layout, copy the contents of 2-column.html
  4. Look in your code for "<-- Put Content Here -->" and replace with your email content.
      * For Images, copy "image.html" into your code where "<-- Put Content Here -->" is located
  5. Once the layout has been achieved, copy the "end.html" contents into your file.
  6. Add styles as necessary to achive the look you want. This will take time and adjustments, but shouldn't be too tough.
